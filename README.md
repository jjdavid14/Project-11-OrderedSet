# Project-11-OrderedSet

A class OrderedSet<E extends Comparable<E>> as a generic collection that stores nodes in a binary
search tree data structure. Each node has a reference to data, a left binary search tree, and a right binary search tree.
The type to be stored must be limited to those that implement the Comparable interface or any interface that extends
Comparable.
